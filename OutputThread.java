 * OutputThread writes data to a peer, and never reads in any data in order to prevent blocking and waiting, or some terrible constant back-and-forth keepalive.

 * Instead, any calls to OutputThread's external methods are extremely lightweight (putting a String in a buffer) rather than waiting on network IO to execute.
