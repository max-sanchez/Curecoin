    /**
     * Constructor for Block object. A block object is made for any confirmed or potential network block, and requires all pieces of data in this constructur
     * to be a valid network block. The timestamp is the result of the miner's initial call to System.currentTimeMillis(). When peers are receiving new blocks
     * (synced with the network, not catching up) they will refuse any blocks that are more than 2 hours off their internal adjusted time. This makes difficulty
     * malleability impossible in the long-run, ensures that timestamps are reasonably accurate, etc. As a result, any clients far off from the true network time
     * will be forked off the network as they won't accept valid network blocks. Make sure your computer's time is set correctly!
     * 
     * All blocks stack in one particular order, and each block contains the hash of the previous block, to clear any ambiguities about which chain a block belongs
     * to during a fork. The winning nonce is concatenated with the certificate and hashed to get a certificate mining score, which is then used to determine
     * whether a block is under the target difficulty. 
     * 
     * Blocks are hashed to create a block hash, which ensures blocks are not altered, and is used in block stacking. The data hashed is formatted as a String:
     * {timestamp:blockNum:previousBlockHash:difficulty:winningNonce},{ledgerHash},{transactions},{redeemAddress:arbitraryData:maxNonce:authorityName:blockNum:prevBlockHash},{certificateSignatureData},{certificateSigantureIndex}
     * The last three chunks of the above are returned by calling getFullCertificate() on a certificate object.
     * Then, the full block (including the hash) is signed by the miner. So:
     * {timestamp:blockNum:previousBlockHash:difficulty:winningNonce},{ledgerHash},{transactions},{redeemAddress:arbitraryData:maxNonce:authorityName:blockNum:prevBlockHash},{certificateSignatureData},{certificateSigantureIndex},{blockHash}
     * will be hashed and signed by the redeemAddress, which should be held by the miner. The final block format:
     * {timestamp:blockNum:previousBlockHash:difficulty:winningNonce},{ledgerHash},{transactions},{redeemAddress:arbitraryData:maxNonce:authorityName:blockNum:prevBlockHash},{certificateSignatureData},{certificateSigantureIndex},{blockHash},{minerSignature},{minerSignatureIndex}
     * 
     * A higher difficulty means a block is harder to mine. However, a higher difficulty means the TARGET is smaller. Targets can be calculated from the difficulty. A target is simply Long.MAX_VALUE-difficulty.
     * 
     * Explicit transactions are represented as Strings in an ArrayList<String>. Each explicit transaction follows the following format:
     * InputAddress;InputAmount;OutputAddress1;OutputAmount1;OutputAddress2;OutputAmount2...;SignatureData;SignatureIndex
     * At a bare minimum, ALL transactions must have an InputAddress, InputAmount, and one OutputAddress and one OutputAmount
     * Anything left over after all OutputAmounts have been subtracted from the InputAmount is the transaction fee which goes to a block miner.
     * The payment of transaction fees and block rewards are IMPLICIT transactions. They never actually appear on the network. Clients, when processing blocks, automatically adjust the ledger as required. 
     * 
     * @param timestamp Timestamp originally set into the block by the miner

     * @param previousBlockHash The hash of the previous block
