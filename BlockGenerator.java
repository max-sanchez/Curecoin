/**
 * This class provides all functionality required to pack and sign blocks. 
 * In order for a block to be valid on the network, it must include a valid timestamp, blockNum, previousBlockHash, difficulty, winningNonce, ledgerHash (not in 2.0.0a1), certificate, and be signed by the miner.
 * 
 * When Curecoin 2.0 receives a certificate over RPC, it will gather the pool of pending transactions, test each transaction for available balances and such, and attempt to create a block, and send it to the network. 
 * Block Format:
 *  {timestamp:blockNum:previousBlockHash:difficulty:winningNonce},{ledgerHash},{transactions},{redeemAddress:arbitraryData:maxNonce:authorityName:blockNum:prevBlockHash},{certificateSignatureData},{certificateSigantureIndex},{blockHash},{minerSignature},{minerSignatureIndex}

     * The parameters are a mouthful. This method takes all of the building blocks (heh....) of a Curecoin block, and compiles them together into a format that the network will accept.
     * Compiling a block consists of lining up all of the block elements until the block hash, hashing the partial block, appending the blockHash, and signing the entire String. 
     * Peers on the network will be able to deconstruct the block in the same process to verify the signature's validity, blockHash, and signature.
     * 
     * @param timestamp Timestamp of block
     * @param blockNum Number of block to create
     * @param difficulty Difficulty to place into new block
     * @param winningNonce The nonce that mines the certificate under the difficulty of the previous block
     * @param ledgerHash Hash of the current ledger BEFORE transactions held in this block are applied
     * @param transactions ArrayList<String> containing all transactions in order to be included in the block
     * @param certificate Certificate used to create the block
     * @param signingAddress Address to sign with, this should be the same as the redeemAddress of certificate
     * @param privateKey Private key of signingAddress, used to create the signature
     * @param minerSignatureIndex Index to use for signing the block
