     * Currently, authority names are hard-coded with special (>18 layer) addresses in a HashMap<String, String>. 
     * In the future, these will be drawn from some external source, and the signature authorities will have robust control over this.
     * 2.0.0a1 is to prove that stuff works and stress test other components of the network--protocol-level support for signature authorities to change their address
     * will probably be demonstrated in 2.0.0a2. Maybe a3. 
     * 
     * @param redeemAddress The address the coinbase will be sent to if this certificate were to mine a block
     * @param arbitraryData Arbitrary data added to the certificate, could be an address for P2Pool, or a username/worker name for a traditional pool.
     * @param authorityName The human-readable name of the signature authority. Example: "CureLabs"
     * @param blockNum The block number this certificate is valid for mining
     * @param prevBlockHash The hash of the previous block a block made using this certificate would stack on top of

     * This method finds the nonce (between 0 and maxNonce) that provides the lowest difficulty score.
     * Used only for mining, lower difficulty scores are better. Peers do not need to run this when confirming certificates.
     * When a peer checks a certificate for mining rights, it simply checks the nonce provided by a peer.
     * Theoretically, a certificate could have several nonces which solve a block. 
     * Performance is more than adequate for intended purpose. Anyone suggesting I multithread this will be ignored. 
     * As this is only called by the miner once, and then never used again for a given certificate, it just has to work well.
     * On one core of an i7-3770K clocked at 3.9GHz, this can perform approximately 647,249 nonce checks per second. YMMV.
     * Using FAH as an example, say a WU was worth 30,000 'points' and for each point, FAH gave you one nonce in the certificate.
     * That seems reasonable.
     * So this method would take 0.04635 seconds on a high-end desktop. You ran a GPU for 6 hours to finish that WU.
     * You can afford to wait 0.04635 seconds to check to see if you earned any coins. :)
     * Originally, the certificate used for mining was going to have the signature used in the hash.
     * However, this provides no additional security (transitive property; if the signature matches the message and the message 
     * when a nonce is appended hashes to below the difficulty, it is a legitimate address.) and was removed for performance
     * considerations. Hashing that much data unnecessarily was decided to be a terrible idea.
     * 
     * Here's how difficulty works: the 'difficulty' grows higher as more people do more computational science per second.
     * A nonce's hash score has to be under a 'target' in order to mine a block.
     * Therefore, as the difficulty grows, the target shrinks. The target is Long.MAX_VALUE / (difficulty/2). The /2 accounts
     * for half of the numbers being negative. 
     * 
     * At a difficulty of 10, 1/10 nonces will be a solution. At a difficulty of 100, 1/100 nonces will be a solution.
     * At a difficulty of 1000, 1/1000 nonces will be a solution. You may notice a pattern.

                 * Quick lesson on binary.

                 * and still work perfectly fine. That being said, my method seems simple. I take the first 8 bytes of the hash, and turn that into a number.
                 * Let's review binary:
                 * {binary = decimal}
                 * 1 = 1
                 * 10 = 2

                 * 1111 = 15
                 * 01111 = 15
                 * 10111 = 17
                 * Cool. So you'll notice that the number is bigger for two same-length pieces of binary when the first digit is a zero. 
                 * This means the most sigificant bit is the left-most-bit.
                 * The above are examples of UNSIGNED conversion.
                 * Cause negative numbers are occasionally useful, Java's Long is signed. That means the first bit dictates whether the number is positive or negative.
                 * In what might appear counter-intuitive at first, if the first digit is a 1, the long is negative. If it is a 0, the long is positive.
                 * As a result, the largest possible unsigned values will start with a 1 as that signed bit position (left-most-bit) normally represents 2^63 on its own. 
                 * Since a hash can be simplified as a mental exercise to spit out 'random' or unpredictable data which has no propensity towards any patterns, this first
                 * bit has a 50 percent chance every hash to be a 1. If it's a 1, it's a huge number anyway (2^63 plus change). 
                 * As a result, there's no reason to even care about any negative longs, as they actually represent the biggest numbers (if longs were unsigned).
                 * 
                 * 111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 is actually a negative number when converted, because a long is a signed number.
                 * If tempDiff is negative, it means its most significant bit is a 1, so if it wasn't signed, it would be huge.
                 * For this reason, it's incredibly safe to discard all negative numbers. If the Curecoin network difficulty is so easy that a Long represented in binary
                 * starting with a 1 can solve it, I'll start folding on a raspberry pie and fix it. There would have to be, on average, only one certificate per three
                 * minutes, with only ONE allowed nonce (0) for the difficulty to drop this low. Aka Curecoin would have to be abandoned. By everyone. At the same time.
                 * In that event, allowing the block time to slip to 6 minutes (the result of discarding a potential solution to the minimum difficulty 50 percent of the
                 * time) probably isn't my biggest concern.
